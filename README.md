Wireless Custom Volume Control Puck with Integrated OLED display

#### This is a WIP personal project to address a personal need for a resonably priced and customizable Rotary encoder for audio control. 

After switching to a brand new mechanical keyboard, I lost my built in volume knob and missed the convience of having a physical dial to control the volume of my music or videos. 

I wanted to build a wireless device that looks production ready and have full functionality while maintaining a minimalistic approach and footprint on my small dorm room desk.
